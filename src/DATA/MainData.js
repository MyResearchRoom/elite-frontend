In CFD, basic three steps are involved i.e., Pre-Processing, Solver and Post Processing. This work specifically addresses the CFD analysis of incinerator chimney. The three dimensional steady state CFD analysis is carried out using ANSYS-FLUENT software to predict the pressure drop in the chimney. ",

              In the first load case, the pressure drop was determined by performing CFD analysis on the existing model. \
              Subsequently, an internal fan (Axial Blower) was incorporated into the model to achieve the desired pressure drop.\
              Multiple iterations were conducted, considering various fan performance data, leading to the selection of a specific fan configuration that successfully achieved the desired pressure drop across the chimney.\
              In the fourth load case, the pressure drop was determined by performing CFD analysis on the new blower location model. An inlet volume flow rate of 200 m3/min is applied at the inlet.\
